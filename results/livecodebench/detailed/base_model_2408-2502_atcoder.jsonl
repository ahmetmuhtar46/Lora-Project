For each key press, he uses his left hand if \\(S_i = L\\) and his right hand if \\(S_i = R\\).

The fatigue level increases by `abs(A_i - i)`.\n\n4. **Initialization**: Start with `dp[0] = 0` because there is no initial fatigue level at the first key.\n\n5. **Filling the DP Table**: Iterate through each key press and update the `dp` table accordingly.\n\nHere's the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef min_fatigue(N, A, S):\n    dp = [0] * 101  # Initialize the DP table with zeros\n    \n    for i in range(1, N + 1):\n        if S[i - 1] == 'L':\n            dp[A[i - 1]] += abs(A[i - 1] - i)\n        else:\n            dp[A[i - 1]] += abs(A[i - 1] - i)\n    \n    return min(dp)\n\n# Read input\nN = int(input())\nA = list(map(int, input().split()))\nS = list(input().split())\n\n# Calculate the minimum fatigue level\nresult = min_fatigue(N, A, S)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n1. **Initialization**: We initialize a list `dp` of size 101 with zeros.

We then update the corresponding position in the `dp` table by adding the absolute difference between the new and old positions.\n3. **Return Result**: Finally, we return the minimum value in the `dp` table, which represents the minimum possible fatigue level at the end of the performance.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently calculate the minimum fatigue level using dynamic programming.", "extracted_code": "def min_fatigue(N, A, S):\n    dp = [0] * 101  # Initialize the DP table with zeros\n    \n    for i in range(1, N + 1):\n        if S[i - 1] == 'L':\n            dp[A[i - 1]] += abs(A[i - 1] - i)\n        else:\n            dp[A[i - 1]] += abs(A[i - 1] - i)\n    \n    return min(dp)\n\n# Read input\nN = int(input())\nA = list(map(int, input().split()))\nS = list(input().split())\n\n# Calculate the minimum fatigue level\nresult = min_fatigue(N, A, S)\nprint(result)", "passed": false, "test_results": {"total": 3, "passed": 0, "failed": 0, "timeout": 0, "error": 3, "pass_rate": 0.0}, "error": null, "timestamp": "2025-12-20T14:14:45.931135"}

He can only eat one strawberry per sequence of consecutive healthy teeth.\n\n2. **Iterate Through the String**: We will iterate through the string `S` and keep track of the current sequence of healthy teeth. Whenever we encounter a cavity (X), we reset our count of healthy teeth.\n\n3. **Update the Maximum Count**: For each sequence of healthy teeth, we update the maximum count if the current sequence is longer than the previously recorded maximum.\n\nHere's the Python code to implement this solution:\n\n```python\ndef max_strawberries(N, K, S):\n    max_count = 0\n    current_count = 0\n    \n    for char in S:\n        if char == 'O':\n            current_count += 1\n            if current_count >= K:\n                max_count = max(max_count, current_count)\n        else:\n            current_count = 0\n    \n    return max_count\n\n# Read input\nN, K = map(int, input().split())\nS = input()\n\n# Calculate and print the result\nprint(max_strawberries(N, K, S))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - `max_count` keeps track of the maximum number of strawberries that can be eaten.\n   - `current_count` keeps track of the number of consecutive healthy teeth currently being considered.\n\n2. **Iteration**:\n   - We iterate through each character in the string `S`.\n   - If the character is 'O', we increment `current_count` and check if it meets or exceeds `K`. If it does, we update `max_count`.\n   - If the character is 'X', we reset `current_count` to 0 because the sequence of healthy teeth has ended.\n\n3. **Result**:\n   - Finally, we return the value of `max_count`, which represents the maximum number of strawberries Takahashi can eat.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the maximum number of strawberries by iterating through the string once and keeping track of the necessary counts.", "extracted_code": "def max_strawberries(N, K, S):\n    max_count = 0\n    current_count = 0\n    \n    for char in S:\n        if char == 'O':\n            current_count += 1\n            if current_count >= K:\n                max_count = max(max_count, current_count)\n        else:\n            current_count = 0\n    \n    return max_count\n\n# Read input\nN, K = map(int, input().split())\nS = input()\n\n# Calculate and print the result\nprint(max_strawberries(N, K, S))", "passed": false, "test_results": {"total": 3, "passed": 0, "failed": 3, "timeout": 0, "error": 0, "pass_rate": 0.0}, "error": null, "timestamp": "2025-12-20T14:18:45.434973"}

Count the frequency of each integer on the four cards.\n2. Check if there are exactly two distinct integers with frequencies of 3 and 2.\n3. If such a combination exists, add one card to either of these integers to form a Full House.\n\nHere's the Python code to implement this logic:\n\n```python\ndef is_full_house(cards):\n    # Count the frequency of each integer\n    freq = {}\n    for card in cards:\n        if card in freq:\n            freq[card] += 1\n        else:\n            freq[card] = 1\n    \n    # Check if there are exactly two distinct integers with frequencies of 3 and 2\n    count_3 = sum(1 for count in freq.values() if count == 3)\n    count_2 = sum(1 for count in freq.values() if count == 2)\n    \n    return count_3 == 1 and count_2 == 1\n\n# Read input\nA, B, C, D = map(int, input().split())\n\n# Determine if adding one card can form a Full House\nif is_full_house([A, B, C, D]):\n    print(\"Yes\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Counting Frequencies**: We use a dictionary `freq` to count the occurrences of each integer in the list `[A, B, C, D]`.\n2. **Checking Conditions**:\n   - `count_3` counts how many integers have a frequency of 3.\n   - `count_2` counts how many integers have a frequency of 2.\n3. **Condition Check**: The function returns `True` if there is exactly one integer with a frequency of 3 and one integer with a frequency of 2, indicating that a Full House can be formed by adding one card to either of these integers.\n\nThis approach ensures that we correctly identify whether adding one card can form a Full House based on the given constraints.", "extracted_code": "def is_full_house(cards):\n    # Count the frequency of each integer\n    freq = {}\n    for card in cards:\n        if card in freq:\n            freq[card] += 1\n        else:\n            freq[card] = 1\n    \n    # Check if there are exactly two distinct integers with frequencies of 3 and 2\n    count_3 = sum(1 for count in freq.values() if count == 3)\n    count_2 = sum(1 for count in freq.values() if count == 2)\n    \n    return count_3 == 1 and count_2 == 1\n\n# Read input\nA, B, C, D = map(int, input().split())\n\n# Determine if adding one card can form a Full House\nif is_full_house([A, B, C, D]):\n    print(\"Yes\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No\")", "passed": false, "test_results": {"total": 5, "passed": 3, "failed": 2, "timeout": 0, "error": 0, "pass_rate": 0.6}, "error": null, "timestamp": "2025-12-20T14:22:43.877801"}

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We start with an empty string and repeatedly append digits to it using the buttons 0 through 9. Our goal is to find the minimum number of button presses needed to reach the string \\( S \\).\n\n2. **Analyze the String \\( S \\)**: Since \\( S \\) consists only of digits (0 through 9), each digit can be appended to the current string in exactly one way. Therefore, the minimum number of button presses required is simply the length of the string \\( S \\).\n\n3. **Implement the Solution**: We can directly return the length of the string \\( S \\) as the answer.\n\nHere's the Python code to implement this solution:\n\n```python\ndef min_button_presses(S):\n    # Return the length of the string S\n    return len(S)\n\n# Read the input string S\nS = input()\n\n# Calculate and print the minimum number of button presses\nprint(min_button_presses(S))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The function `min_button_presses` takes a string \\( S \\) as input.\n- It returns the length of the string \\( S \\) using the built-in `len()` function.\n- The main part of the code reads the input string \\( S \\) from standard input using `input()`.\n- Finally, it prints the result of calling `min_button_presses(S)`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we correctly calculate the minimum number of button presses required to display the string \\( S \\).", "extracted_code": "def min_button_presses(S):\n    # Return the length of the string S\n    return len(S)\n\n# Read the input string S\nS = input()\n\n# Calculate and print the minimum number of button presses\nprint(min_button_presses(S))", "passed": false, "test_results": {"total": 3, "passed": 1, "failed": 2, "timeout": 0, "error": 0, "pass_rate": 0.3333333333333333}, "error": null, "timestamp": "2025-12-20T14:23:00.061478"}
